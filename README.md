# DTMlite
### DTM (Short For Dan The Man) Lite is a simple JSON editor to make use of DTM's low backup security, giving the user access to change any data value (gold, tokens, premium etc)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### First of all we have to understand if you need to sideload DTM to your device or if you can just download it from the AppStore (note: this does not work for android devices yet). You can simply check by downloading DTM via AppStore and quickly go through the prologue and head into Files > On My Iphone and see if there's a folder named "Dan The Man". If not, you're gonna have to sideload it.

<summary> How to sideload DTM </summary>
<ul>
 <li> In order to sideload any app you need 2 things, a IPA (IOS package app store) and a sideload method, such as <a href="https://altstore.io">AltStore</a>, <a href="https://sideloadly.io/">Sideloadly</a> and <a href="https://usescarlet.com/">Scarlet</a>. If this is your first time sideloading then the above 3 sideloading methods should work just fine, but if you're how "Revoked" (basically Apple found out you were getting 3rd party apps and stopped access to your certificate) you can buy a certificate. The cheapest one I recommend is <a href="https://maplesign.ca">Maplesign</a> for just $7 you can get your very own certificate. if you dont wanna spend any money you can use <a href="https://resources.usescarlet.com/install.php">ScarletCloud</a> Simply click the link and make sure to select "Computer (No-Revokes)" and follow the given instructions. If for some reason you don't have access to a computer or your ScarletCloud isn't working (highly unlikely) you can go for a more unethical way, using leaked certificates.</li>
